Title: Ceres
Description: In Ceres you play as a spaceship fighting a series of enemies. On either side of the player is a continuous flow of asteroids. Both enemies and asteroids need to be avoided with the objective being to survive and defeat as many enemies as possible.

#How-to-Play
  Controls: You can move the ship left and right using the A and D keys respectively, the SPACE key can be used to fire a laser.
Gameplay: You get a point for killing an enemy. Once an enemy dies a new enemy spawns with a randomized fire rate and speed (So be careful and always aware).

#Features
Asteroid Belt: On either side of the player are asteroids that are slow but numerous and destroy the player on contact. They extend the border for the player to where the enemy can no longer hit them. This is important because sometimes an enemy will spawn with an insane fire rate and speed making it advantageous for the player to take their chances in the asteroid belt until they can take the opportunity to hit the enemy.

#Assets
The only assets used are unity primitives as well as lights. Modified code snippets from my unit 2 project are also used.
